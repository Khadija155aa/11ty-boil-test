# Stardate 3425.7 - First Contact  
<!-- The explorer's log entry title -->

I arrived on a planet unlike any I have seen before. The sky glows with a permanent aurora, and the air is thick with the scent of something unfamiliar. Strange, bioluminescent creatures glide above me, their translucent wings catching the light of a distant sun.  

I must proceed with cautionâ€”who knows what else calls this place home?
