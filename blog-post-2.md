# Stardate 3430.9 - Nebula Storm  
<!-- The explorer encounters a cosmic danger -->

Navigating through the nebula was a mistake. Electrical discharges flare unpredictably, and my ship’s systems flicker under the strain. I try to remain calm, but the swirling plasma outside makes it impossible to predict my next move.  

If I make it through, I’ll need to rethink my exploration strategy.
